# Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN 😄😢😡

This project is a facial emotion recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It includes two interactive interfaces:
- A real-time webcam interface using **OpenCV**
- A graphical user interface (GUI) using **Tkinter**

The system is capable of detecting facial expressions such as happy, sad, angry, and more.
